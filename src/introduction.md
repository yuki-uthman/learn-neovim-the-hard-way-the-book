# Introduction

Welcome to Learn Neovim The Hard Way, a book for those who believe in the power
of __persistence and repetition__. Inspired by Steve Loshâ€™s excellent Learn
Vimscript the Hard Way, this book follows the same philosophy: there are no
shortcuts to __MASTERY__. Learning Neovim requires focus, patience, and a
commitment to practice.

The method is straightforward:
- learn one thing
- practice until you can do it without thinking
- repeat __once__
- repeat __twice__
- repeat __thrice__
- still not enough?
- __repeat repeat repeat__
- well... you get the point

Each chapter presents a new skill, but the key is to not rush. Take at least
__a few days__ to repeat the exercises, letting the actions become automatic to
the point where your finger moves without thinking about it before moving to
the next skill. Mastery isnâ€™t achieved by speeding through content, but by
building strong, lasting habits through repetition, more repetition, and yes,
even more repetition.

This approach emphasizes the importance of slow but steady learning. By taking
your time, practicing consistently, and committing each skill to muscle memory,
you'll gradually transition into using Neovim as your daily tool without even
realizing it. If youâ€™ve ever gone through tutorials that left you overwhelmed
with information and didnâ€™t change your workflow at all, this book is your
friend. No more consuming endless tutorials without real progressâ€”Learn
Neovim The Hard Way forces you to slow down, focus, and truly learn.

Remember, thereâ€™s no fast track to MASTERY. Just focused effort, one small step
at a time. Youâ€™ll need to repeat the same tasks over and over, and thereâ€™s no
way around that. PERIOD. This may seem like a slow process, but the long-term
rewards are immense. Why? Because once you master Neovim, youâ€™ll be spending so
much of your time using it. As a programmerâ€”or someone aspiring to be
oneâ€”youâ€™ll be writing code for the rest of your career. So, why not invest a
little time now to master the tool that will shape your entire workflow?

Even if it takes a year (just for argumentâ€™s sake), what is that compared to
the decades youâ€™ll spend writing code? Neovim enhances the joy of coding and
keeps improving every year. Itâ€™s a small investment if you plan to code for
life. Plus, letâ€™s be honestâ€”using Neovim puts you in the ranks of the
programmer's elite. (People really do get impressed when they hear you're using
Neovim ðŸ˜Ž.)

So buckle up because this journey will take time...
