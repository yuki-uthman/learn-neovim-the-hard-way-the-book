# Introduction

Welcome to Learn Neovim The Hard Way, a book for those who believe in the power
of __persistence and repetition__. Inspired by Steve Loshâ€™s excellent Learn
Vimscript the Hard Way, this book follows the same philosophy: there are no
shortcuts to __MASTERY__. Learning Neovim requires focus, patience, and a
commitment to practice.

The method is straightforward: 
- learn one thing
- practice until you can do it without thinking
- repeat __once__
- repeat __twice__
- repeat __thrice__
- still not enough?
- __repeat repeat repeat__
- well... you get the point

Each chapter presents a new skill, but the key is to not rush. Take at least
__a few days__ to repeat the exercises, letting the actions become automatic to
the point where your finger moves without thinking about it before moving to
the next skill. Mastery isnâ€™t achieved by speeding through content, but by
building strong, lasting habits through repetition, repeatition, and
repetition.

This approach, inspired by Steve Loshâ€™s work, emphasizes the importance of deep
learning. By taking your time, practicing consistently, and committing each
skill to muscle memory, youâ€™ll be able to switch to Neovim eventually.

Remember, thereâ€™s no fast track to __MASTERY__â€”just focused effort, one micro
step at a time. Letâ€™s dive in, with the understanding that this journey will
take time, but the rewards are well worth it. Why? Because you will be spending
so much of your time in Neovim once you learn it. That is because most probably
if you are reading this book, you are either already a programmer or someone
aspiring to be a prorammer. So hopefully you enjoy writing code and you will be
spending the rest of your life writing code. So why not invest the time to the
tools that you will be using for the rest of your life to make the experience
even better! After all Neovim is super fun to use and is keep getting better
each year. And you get to join the programmer's elite! ( Somehow people get
impressed if they know you are using Neovim ðŸ˜Ž)
